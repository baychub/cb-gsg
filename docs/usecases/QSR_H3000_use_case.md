![QSR H3000 Use Case](../images/QSR_H3000.png)

This use case demonstrates configuring the Intel&reg; RSP H3000 Devkit Sensors and Intel&reg; RSP 
Controller Application as deployed in a typical quick serve restaurant (qsr) environment.

## Goals
- Manage a deployment with two separate facilities of interest ... Receiving-Exiting and DryGoods
- Know when tagged items come into the restaurant
- Know the location of a tagged item (sensor and facility)
- Know when a tagged item has moved from Receiving-Exiting to the DryGoods or vice-versa
- Know when a tagged item has left the restaurant
  
By the end of the example, you will be able to track a tag as it arrives through Receiving-Exiting, 
transitions to DryGoods, and then departs out the exit (Receiving-Exiting).
  
## Prerequsites  
1. It is assumed that the controller is already running and the sensors are running and connected to the 
controller.

2. In [DevkitQsrCluster.json](./DevkitQsrCluster.json), edit the sensor device ids in the 
sensor_groups to match the sensors included with the Devkit. 
This cluster configuration file is an example that establishes the two facilities of interest 
(Receiving-Exiting, DryGoods), configures one sensor to be in Receiving-Exiting and the other sensor to 
be in DryGoods, assigns the Receiving-Exiting sensor with an EXIT personality in order to detect when 
tags have gone out the entryway, and assigns appropriate behaviors for reading RFID tags.  

3. Hide the Tags  
Make sure no tags are visible to the sensors in order to see a complete use case scenario.

## Configure / Control the Intel&reg; RSP Controller Application
After the prerequisites have been met, choose one of the following methods to configure and control the 
application. Each method accomplishes the same configuration tasks.
- Using the Web Admin
- Using the Command Line Interface (CLI)
- Using the MQTT Messaging API

Note: In the following instructions, the term YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY will refer to the directory where the 
cloned rsp-sw-toolkit-gw repo contents reside, and the term YOUR_DEPLOY_DIRECTORY will refer to the directory 
where the Intel&reg; RSP Controller Application was deployed.

___

### USING THE WEB ADMIN
1. Open the [web admin](http://localhost:8080/web-admin) page and confirm that the sensors included in the 
dev kit are connected. This can be seen on the [dashboard](http://localhost:8080/web-admin/dashboard.html) 
page or the [sensors](http://localhost:8080/web-admin/sensors-main.html) page.

2. On the [scheduler](http://localhost:8080/web-admin/scheduler.html) page, stop the sensors from reading 
by selecting the INACTIVE run state.

3. On the [inventory](http://localhost:8080/web-admin/inventory-main.html) page, press the Unload button 
to clear out all previous tag history to start a clean session.

4. On the [behaviors](http://localhost:8080/web-admin/behaviors.html) page, use the Upload From File
button to upload all of the use case behaviors to the controller. The behavior files can be found at 
YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY/rsp-sw-toolkit-gw/examples/use-cases/qsr/h3000, matching the pattern 
DevkitQsrBehavior*.json.  

    These __MUST__ be loaded to the controller __BEFORE__ the cluster configuration because the cluster
    file references those behavior ids, and the behaviors must already be known by the controller. Otherwise
    the loading of the cluster configuration file will fail validation.

5. Upload the __edited__ cluster configuration file (see Prerequistes) using the 
[cluster config](http://localhost:8080/web-admin/cluster-config.html) page.

6. On the [scheduler](http://localhost:8080/web-admin/scheduler.html) page, start the sensors reading 
according to the cluster configuration by selecting the FROM_CONFIG run state. The clusters that the 
scheduler is using will be displayed on the page.

7. On the [sensors](http://localhost:8080/web-admin/sensors-main.html) page, confirm that the sensors have 
been configured as expected and are reading tags according to the cluster configuration file.

8. Navigate to the [inventory](http://localhost:8080/web-admin/inventory-main.html) page which can be used 
to monitor tag reads and states.

Continue to the Observe Tag Events section.
___
  
### USING THE CLI
1. Open a terminal window and copy the use case behaviors to the deployed controller so they are available 
for use.
    ```bash
    cd YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY/rsp-sw-toolkit-gw/examples/use-cases/qsr/h3000
    cp DevkitQsrBehavior*.json YOUR_DEPLOY_DIRECTORY/rsp-sw-toolkit-gw/config/behaviors/
    ```

2. Connect to the controller's command line interface and execute the following series of commands.
    ```bash
    ssh -p5222 console@localhost
    password: console
        
    #-- stop the scheduler
    cli> scheduler set.run.state INACTIVE 
    ------------------------------------------
    completed
    ------------------------------------------
    
    #-- unload the current inventory
    cli> inventory unload 
    ------------------------------------------
    unload complete
    ------------------------------------------
    
    #-- load the cluster configuration
    cli> clusters load.file YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY/rsp-sw-toolkit-gw/examples/use-cases/qsr/h3000/DevkitQsrCluster.json
    ------------------------------------------
    completed
    ------------------------------------------
    
    #-- activate the scheduler in custom configuration mode
    cli> scheduler set.run.state FROM_CONFIG 
    ------------------------------------------
    completed
    ------------------------------------------

    #-- confirm the configuration is active 
    cli> scheduler show 
    ------------------------------------------
    runState: FROM_CONFIG
    ------------------------------------------
    clusters:
          id: DryGoodsCluster
    behavior: DevkitQsrBehaviorMobility_PORTS_1
    sensors: [RSP-150003 ]
    
    ------------------------------------------
          id: Receiving-ExitingCluster
    behavior: DevkitQsrBehaviorExit_PORTS_1
    sensors: [RSP-150001 ]
    
    ------------------------------------------
    ```

Continue to the Observe Tag Events section.

### USING MQTT:
1. Edit [cluster_set_config_request_use_case_qsr.json](./cluster_set_config_request_use_case_qsr.json) 
replacing "CONTENTS_OF_CLUSTER_CONFIG_GO_HERE" with the contents of the edited DevkitQsrCluster.json file. 

2. Open a terminal window and subscribe to the controller's command response topic in order to monitor the 
command responses.
    ```bash
    #-- monitor the rpc command responses
    mosquitto_sub -t rfid/controller/response
    ```

3. Open another terminal to send JsonRPC commands over MQTT to configure and control the controller.
    ```bash
    #-- change directory to the examples folder 
    #-- so the example commands work correctly
    cd YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY/rsp-sw-toolkit-gw/examples
    
    #-- stop the scheduler
    mosquitto_pub -t rfid/controller/command -f api/upstream/scheduler_set_run_state_request_INACTIVE.json
    
    #-- unload the current inventory
    mosquitto_pub -t rfid/controller/command -f api/upstream/inventory_unload_request.json
    
    #-- load behaviors specific to this exercise
    #-- (lowered power levels as sensors are likely interferring)
    mosquitto_pub -t rfid/controller/command -f use-cases/qsr/h3000/behavior_put_request_Exit.json
    mosquitto_pub -t rfid/controller/command -f use-cases/qsr/h3000/behavior_put_request_Mobility.json
    
    #-- load (set) the cluster configuration
    mosquitto_pub -t rfid/controller/command -f use-cases/qsr/h3000/cluster_set_config_request_use_case_qsr.json
    
    #-- activate the scheduler in custom configuration mode
    mosquitto_pub -t rfid/controller/command -f api/upstream/scheduler_set_run_state_request_FROM_CONFIG.json
    ```

Continue to the Observe Tag Events section.
___

## Observe Tag Events
Check that the sensors are not pointed in conflicting directions as much as possible. 
(The H3000 antennae are directional).

Open a terminal window and subscribe to the controller events topic in order to monitor 
tag events as produced by the controller.

```bash
#-- monitor the upstream events topic
mosquitto_sub -t rfid/controller/events
```

1. ##### Tag arrival in Receiving-Exiting
    At this point, remove a tag from hiding and place it nearby the Receiving-Exiting sensor. 
    When the tag is read initially, an arrival event will be generated on the rfid/controller/events topic.
    Verify from the Web Admin 
    [inventory](http://localhost:8080/web-admin/inventory-main.html) page that the tag is now in the EXITING
    state and the location is at the Receiving-Exiting sensor.  
    Verify the receipt of the MQTT event message.
    ```json
    {
      "jsonrpc": "2.0",
      "method": "inventory_event",
      "params": {
        "sent_on": 1559867406651,
        "device_id": "intel-acetest",
        "data": [
          {
            "facility_id": "Receiving-Exiting",
            "epc_code": "303530C29C000000F0006B12",
            "tid": null,
            "epc_encode_format": "tbd",
            "event_type": "arrival",
            "timestamp": 1559867406524,
            "location": "RSP-150001-0"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
    ```    

2. ##### Tagged item is moved to DryGoods (departure from Receiving-Exiting and arrival in DryGoods)
    Now move the tag from the Receiving-Exiting sensor to the DryGoods sensor. Since these sensors are in 
    different facilities, the events generated will be a 'departure' from Receiving-Exiting and an 'arrival' 
    into DryGoods. It may take a few moments for the event(s) to be generated as the algorithm uses 
    time-weighted RSSI averages to determine the tag location. From the 
    [inventory](http://localhost:8080/web-admin/inventory-main.html) page, confirm that the tag has changed 
    locations to the second sensor (DryGoods) and that the tag state has changed to PRESENT.  
    Verify the receipt of the MQTT event message.
    ```json
    {
      "jsonrpc": "2.0",
      "method": "inventory_event",
      "params": {
        "sent_on": 1559867429368,
        "device_id": "intel-acetest",
        "data": [
          {
            "facility_id": "Receiving-Exiting",
            "epc_code": "303530C29C000000F0006B12",
            "tid": null,
            "epc_encode_format": "tbd",
            "event_type": "departed",
            "timestamp": 1559867428832,
            "location": "RSP-150001-0"
          },
          {
            "facility_id": "DryGoods",
            "epc_code": "303530C29C000000F0006B12",
            "tid": null,
            "epc_encode_format": "tbd",
            "event_type": "arrival",
            "timestamp": 1559867429172,
            "location": "RSP-150003-0"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
    ```

3. ##### Tagged item is staged for trashing (departure from DryGoods and arrival in Receiving-Exiting)
    Now move the tag back to the Receiving-Exiting sensor.  Again, since the two sensors are in 
    different facilities, there will be a departure-arrival pair of events generated. Again, this can 
    take a few moments to occur. From the [inventory](http://localhost:8080/web-admin/inventory-main.html) 
    page, confirm that the location changes back to Receiving-Exiting and the tag's state changes to EXITING.  
    Verify the receipt of the MQTT event message.
    ```json
    {
      "jsonrpc": "2.0",
      "method": "inventory_event",
      "params": {
        "sent_on": 1559867432813,
        "device_id": "intel-acetest",
        "data": [
          {
            "facility_id": "DryGoods",
            "epc_code": "303530C29C000000F0006B12",
            "tid": null,
            "epc_encode_format": "tbd",
            "event_type": "departed",
            "timestamp": 1559867432117,
            "location": "RSP-150003-0"
          },
          {
            "facility_id": "Receiving-Exiting",
            "epc_code": "303530C29C000000F0006B12",
            "tid": null,
            "epc_encode_format": "tbd",
            "event_type": "arrival",
            "timestamp": 1559867432492,
            "location": "RSP-150001-0"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
    ```

4. ##### Tagged item is taken out to trash (departure from Receiving-Exiting)
    Hide the tag so that no sensor is able to read it to emulate the tag actually being gone. After 
    about 30 seconds, a departed event should be generated from the Receiving-Exiting sensor. From 
    the [inventory](http://localhost:8080/web-admin/inventory-main.html) page, confirm that the state 
    changes to DEPARTED_EXIT.  
    Verify the receipt of the MQTT event message.
    ```json
    {
      "jsonrpc": "2.0",
      "method": "inventory_event",
      "params": {
        "sent_on": 1559867434772,
        "device_id": "intel-acetest",
        "data": [
          {
            "facility_id": "Receiving-Exiting",
            "epc_code": "303530C29C000000F0006B12",
            "tid": null,
            "epc_encode_format": "tbd",
            "event_type": "departed",
            "timestamp": 1559867434476,
            "location": "RSP-150001-0"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
    ```
