# Tutorials for QSR and Retail Use Cases
Below are tutorials for two common use cases for RFID implementations: quick-service restaurants (QSR) and retail environments. Each is specific to the type of Intel&reg; RSP hardware that comes with a developer kit, either the H1000 or H3000 model.

Each tutorial walks through configuration steps for enabling RFID functionality for the specific needs of the QSR or retail usage.
