# Update Sensor Software

Software on the RSP sensors allows you to post an update package on the edge computer and have the RSP Controller application automatically install the package on all of the sensors connected to that edge computer.

1. On the edge computer, get the sensor software update from [URL for update home].

2. In a terminal window, expand the update package file and move the contents to the sensor software directory with these commands:
```
#-- Start in directory where you downloaded the sensor update
tar -xf <filename_of_sensor_update>
cd ~/deploy/rsp-sw-toolkit-gw/sensor-sw-repo
```
Sensors check this location for updates every 5 minutes. In a few minutes the sensors will automatically find and install the update.
