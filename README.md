# Getting Started
The Intel&reg; RFID Sensor Platform (RSP) Software Toolkit is open source software that allows you to configure and pull data from Intel RSP sensors as part of an RFID system. The following getting started guides tell how to quickly set up the hardware and software for a test st. 

The topology allows many sensors to be connected to an edge computer (a Linux or Windows PC) that runs the RSP Controller application. This software configures the sensors, filters raw RFID data for meaningful changes, and publishes the data over the MQTT message broker. 

*Note: The application can potentially run (though not yet tested) on other operating systems that can run the Java Runtime Environment v.8 or later.* 

Choose the getting started guide for operating system of your edge computer:
